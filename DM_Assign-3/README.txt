Steps to run:
1. Place all the matlab (.m) files along with data set folders in Matlab workspace.
2. Now individually run every script.

Scripts are as follows:
1. KNN_1a - Question 1, part (a)
2. SVM_1b - Question 1, part (b)
3. KNN_2a - Question 2, part (a)
4. ANN_2b - Question 2, part (b)
5. SVM_2c - Question 2, part (c)

Generalized SVM program for any kind of dataset (not dependent on dimension of dataset):
6. SVM_1b_v2 - Question 1, part (b)
7. SVM_2c_v2 - Question 2, part (c)
