Steps to run:
1. Place all the matlab (.m) files along with data set folders (Active Learning, Clustering) in Matlab workspace.
2. Now individually run every script.

Scripts are as follows:
1. clustering_q1 - Question 1
2. ActiveLearning_q2 - Question 2

* Supporting functions should also be in same folder as .m files and dataset:
1. mykmeans - Function for clustering_q1
2. myActiveLearningRandom, myActiveLearningUncertaintyBased - Functions for ActiveLearning_q2
3. All other are important functions used for train_LR_classifier() and test_LR_classifier().
